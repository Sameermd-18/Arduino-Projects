# Arduino Projects

This repository contains my Arduino projects.  

## 🔧 Project 1: Self-Watering System

This project automatically waters plants using a soil moisture sensor and relay module.Have also used HC-05 Module for Manual Control.

### 🧠 What it does:
- Detects soil moisture using analog sensor
- Activates water pump via relay if soil is dry
- Turns off pump when moisture is sufficient
- We can use mobile to control the motor pump  manually through bluetooth.  (App used :BlueTooth Serial Controller )


## 🔧 Project 2: Digital Speedometer (Tachometer)

## ⚙️ Working Principle
Every time the IR sensor detects the tape (white reflection), it triggers an interrupt. The Arduino counts the number of detections in a second and converts it to RPM.
