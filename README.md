This repository contains my Arduino projects.  
Currently added: **Self Watering System Project**


## ðŸ”§ Project 1: Self-Watering System

This project automatically waters plants using a soil moisture sensor and relay module.Have also used HC-05 Module for Manual Control.

### ðŸ“¹ Demo Video
[ðŸ‘‰ Watch the project in action](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8ggh9kyth0oh08d3d96pb/AGS0kbTOPY8N4caw2Rg_SCo?rlkey=miu6vn2pq1xycrqj9e6o6g4bl&st=uuuvuex9&dl=0)

### ðŸ§  What it does:
- Detects soil moisture using analog sensor
- Activates water pump via relay if soil is dry
- Turns off pump when moisture is sufficient
- We can use mobile to control the motor pump  manually through bluetooth.  (App used :BlueTooth Serial Controller )
